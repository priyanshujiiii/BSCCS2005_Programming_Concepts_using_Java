```java
import java.util.*;
public class Test{
      public static void main(String[] args){
          var num=new ArrayList<Integer>();
           for(int i=10;i>0;i--){
               num.add(i);
           }
           num.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 != 0).limit(2).forEach(System.out::println);
     }
}
```

1. The first line is an import statement that imports the java.util package, which contains various utility classes such as ArrayList and Scanner.
2. The second line defines a public class named "Test".
3. The third line defines a public static method named "main", which is the entry point of the program and accepts a String array argument named "args".
4.  The fourth line creates a new ArrayList of integers and assigns it to a variable named "num".
5. The fifth line starts a for loop that will iterate from 10 to 1, inclusive, and adds each value to the "num" ArrayList using the add() method.
6. The sixth line uses the stream() method to convert the ArrayList to a stream of integers.
7. The seventh line uses the filter() method to filter out even numbers (i.e., numbers that are not divisible by 2) from the stream.
8. The eighth line uses the limit() method to limit the number of filtered elements to 2.
9. The ninth line uses the forEach() method to print each filtered element to the console using a method reference (System.out::println).
10. When you run the program, it will output the two odd numbers from the "num" ArrayList, which are 9 and 7.
