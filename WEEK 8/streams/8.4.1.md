<h3> java code</h3>

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Test{
    static long count=0;
    public static void main(String[] args){
            var list=new ArrayList<String>();
            list.add("Sun");
            list.add("Earth");
            list.add("Moon");
            count=list.stream().filter(s->s.length()>3).count();
            System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```

<h3> line by line execution</h3>

```java
import java.util.*;
```
This line imports the java.util package which provides a collection framework, array-based data structures, event handling, date-time processing, and other utility classes.

```java
public class Test{
```

This line starts the definition of a public class called Test.

```java
static long count=0;
```

This line declares a static variable count of type long and initializes it to 0.

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
```

This line defines the main method, which is the entry point for the Java program. The method takes an array of Strings as an argument.

```java
var list=new ArrayList<String>();
```

This line creates a new ArrayList object that can hold String elements, and assigns it to the variable list. The keyword var is used instead of explicitly declaring the type of the variable.

```java
list.add("Sun");
list.add("Earth");
list.add("Moon");
```

These lines add the String objects "Sun", "Earth", and "Moon" to the ArrayList object list.

```java
count=list.stream().filter(s->s.length()>3).count();
```

This line creates a stream from the elements of list, applies a filter operation that only keeps elements with a length greater than 3, and then counts the remaining elements. The result is assigned to the variable count.

```java
System.out.println(count);
```

This line prints the value of the variable count to the console.

So the output of the program will be the number of elements in list that have a length greater than 3, which is 2 because "Sun" has length 3 and "Earth" and "Moon" both have length greater than 3. Therefore, the program will output 2.
