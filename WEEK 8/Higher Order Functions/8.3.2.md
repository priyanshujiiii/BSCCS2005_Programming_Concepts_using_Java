```
<h3>Line by line execution of above code</h3>

1. The code defines a functional interface named "Destination" with a single abstract method "book" that takes two String parameters and returns a double.

```java
public interface Destination{
    double book(String initial, String target);
```

2. The interface also has a default method named "message" which prints "Functional interface" to the console.

```java
    default void message(){
        System.out.println("Functional interface");
    }
}
```

3. The "Test" class has a main method that creates a reference of the "Destination" interface named "ref" and implements the "book" method using a lambda expression that takes two Strings, prints a message to the console, and returns a double value of 3.5.

```java
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Destination ref=(A,B)-> {
            System.out.println("Travel from "+A+" to "+B);
            return 3.5;
        };
```

4. The main method then calls the "book" method on the "ref" reference, passing in two String arguments "X" and "Y". The returned value is stored in a double variable named "fare".

```java
        double fare=ref.book("X","Y");
```

5. Finally, the main method prints the "fare" variable and calls the "message" default method on the "ref" reference, which prints "Functional interface" to the console.

```java
        System.out.println("Fare: "+fare+" dollars");
        ref.message();
    }
}
```

When the code is executed, it will print the following output to the console:

```vbnet
Travel from X to Y
Fare: 3.5 dollars
Functional interface
```
