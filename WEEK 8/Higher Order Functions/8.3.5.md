<h3>java code</h3>
```java
public interface X{
     boolean display(int a);
 }
 public class Example{
      public static boolean show(int b){
         return b>10;
     }
 }
 public class Test{
     public static void main(String[] args){
	 X ref=Example::show;
	 System.out.println(ref.display(1));
     }
 }
```
<h3>line by line execution</h3>

```java
public interface X{
     boolean display(int a);
 }
```
<h3>This declares an interface named X with a single method display that takes an integer as an argument and returns a boolean value.</h3>

```java
public class Example{
      public static boolean show(int b){
         return b>10;
     }
 }
```
<h3>This declares a class named Example with a static method show that takes an integer b as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether b is greater than 10.</h3>

```java
public class Test{
     public static void main(String[] args){
	 X ref=Example::show;
	 System.out.println(ref.display(1));
     }
 }
```
This declares a class named Test with a main method.

In the main method, the code creates a reference variable ref of type X and assigns it the reference to the show method of the Example class using the :: operator.

Then, the code calls the display method on the ref object passing the integer value 1 as an argument. Since 1 is not greater than 10, the output of the program would be false.

So, the overall output of the program would be:
```arduino
false
```
<h3>because 1 is not greater than 10.</h3>
