<h3>Java Code</h3>

```java
public interface Example{
	void show();
	default void display(){
 	    System.out.println(2);
      }
	static void reveal(){
	   System.out.println(3);
        }
 }
 public class Test{
     public static void main(String[] args){
	  Example ref=()-> System.out.println(1);
	  ref.show();
     }
}
```

<h3>Line by Line execution above code</h3>

Sure! Here's a line-by-line execution of the code:

1. The code defines a public interface called "Example".
2. The interface has one method called "show()", which takes no arguments and returns no value.
3. The interface also has a default method called "display()", which prints the number 2 to the console.
4. The interface also has a static method called "reveal()", which prints the number 3 to the console.
5. The code defines a public class called "Test".
6. The class has a public static method called "main", which takes an array of Strings as its argument.
7. Inside the main method, the code creates a lambda expression that implements the "show()" method of the "Example" interface. The lambda expression simply prints the number 1 to the console.
8. The code creates a reference variable called "ref" of type "Example", and assigns it the lambda expression created in step 7.
9. The code calls the "show()" method on the "ref" variable, which executes the lambda expression created in step 7 and prints the number 1 to the console.

So, when the program is executed, it will print the following output to the console:

1

Because the lambda expression assigned to "ref" in the main method implements the "show()" method of the "Example" interface, and the "show()" method simply prints the number 1 to the console. The "display()" and "reveal()" methods of the "Example" interface are not called in this program.
