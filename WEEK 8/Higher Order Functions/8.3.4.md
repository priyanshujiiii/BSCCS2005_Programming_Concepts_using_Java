<h3>java code</h3>
```java
public interface X{
	void message();
 }
 public interface Y extends X{
	void display();
 }
 public class Test {
	public static void main(String arg[]) {
	      X ref = () -> {
	      System.out.println("Interface X");
	      };
             Y ref2 = () -> {
             System.out.println("Interface Y");
             };
           ref.message();
          ref2.display();
     }
 }
```
The code defines an interface X with a method message(), which has no implementation. Then it defines another interface Y which extends X and adds a new method display(), also with no implementation.

Finally, a class Test is defined with a main() method. Inside main(), a variable ref of type X is declared and initialized with a lambda expression that defines the implementation of the message() method. The lambda expression simply prints a message to the console.

Then, another variable ref2 of type Y is declared and initialized with a lambda expression that defines the implementation of the display() method. The lambda expression also prints a message to the console.

Finally, the message() method is called on the ref variable, and the display() method is called on the ref2 variable, causing the messages defined in the lambda expressions to be printed to the console.
