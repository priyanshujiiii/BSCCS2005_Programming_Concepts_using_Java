<h3>The statement means that if a method in a subclass throws an exception that is not a subclass of the exception thrown by the same method in its superclass, then the subclass method cannot increase the scope of the exception thrown by its superclass method. This is because it would violate the rule that a subclass method cannot throw an exception that is broader than the exception thrown by its superclass method. Instead, it can only throw an exception that is a subclass of the exception thrown by its superclass method or no exception at all. This is known as the “exception rule” in Java.</h3>
