This program generates compile time error because it is not possible to increase the scope of the exception in the overriding methods.
```
<h3>The statement means that if a method in a subclass throws an exception that is not a subclass of the exception thrown by the same method in its superclass, then the subclass method cannot increase the scope of the exception thrown by its superclass method. This is because it would violate the rule that a subclass method cannot throw an exception that is broader than the exception thrown by its superclass method. Instead, it can only throw an exception that is a subclass of the exception thrown by its superclass method or no exception at all. This is known as the “exception rule” in Java.</h3>

This program generates compile time error because it is illegal to increase the visibility from protected to public in the overriding methods.
```
<h3>The statement means that if a subclass method tries to increase the visibility of a method from protected to public in the overriding methods, then it will generate a compile-time error. This is because it would violate the rule that a subclass method cannot increase the visibility of a method in its superclass. Instead, it can only decrease the visibility of a method in its superclass or keep it the same. This is known as the “visibility rule” in Java.</h3>
