<h3>In Java, clone() is a method that creates a copy of an object. It is used to create a new object with the same values as an existing object. The clone() method is defined in the Object class and can be overridden by any class that implements it. The clone() method creates a new object of the same type as the original object and initializes it with the same values as the original object1.
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the clone() method in Java:</h3>

```java
public class Employee implements Cloneable {
   private String name;
   private double salary;

   public Employee(String name, double salary) {
      this.name = name;
      this.salary = salary;
   }

   public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
      return super.clone();
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Employee emp1 = new Employee("John Doe", 50000);
      try {
         Employee emp2 = (Employee) emp1.clone();
         System.out.println(emp2.name);
         System.out.println(emp2.salary);
      } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

<h3>This code creates two objects of type Employee. The first object is created using the constructor, and the second object is created using the clone() method. The clone() method returns an object of type Object, so we need to cast it to an object of type Employee</h3>
