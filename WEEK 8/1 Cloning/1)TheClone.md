<h3>In Java, clone() is a method that creates a copy of an object. It is used to create a new object with the same values as an existing object. The clone() method is defined in the Object class and can be overridden by any class that implements it. The clone() method creates a new object of the same type as the original object and initializes it with the same values as the original object1.
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the clone() method in Java:</h3>

```java
public class Employee implements Cloneable {
   private String name;
   private double salary;

   public Employee(String name, double salary) {
      this.name = name;
      this.salary = salary;
   }

   public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
      return super.clone();
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Employee emp1 = new Employee("John Doe", 50000);
      try {
         Employee emp2 = (Employee) emp1.clone();
         System.out.println(emp2.name);
         System.out.println(emp2.salary);
      } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

<h3>This code creates two objects of type Employee. The first object is created using the constructor, and the second object is created using the clone() method. The clone() method returns an object of type Object, so we need to cast it to an object of type Employee</h3>

<h3>what is super clone doing here </h3>
<p>The super.clone() method creates a binary copy of the original object and then deep copy will be performed accordingly based on the binary copy1. In the code you provided, super.clone() is used to create a new object of type Employee with the same values as the original object</p>
<h3>what is printstacktrace doing in above code </h3>
<p>The printStackTrace() method in Java is used to print the stack trace of an exception along with other details like the class name and line number where the exception occurred123. It helps programmers understand where the actual problem occurred and trace the exception4.

In the code you provided, it is used to print the stack trace of an exception if it occurs during cloning</p>
