<h3>In Java, a shallow copy is a copy of an object that shares the same memory location as the original object. This means that if you modify the original object, the copy will also be modified. A shallow copy can be created using the clone() method12.

A deep copy, on the other hand, is a copy of an object that has its own memory location. This means that if you modify the original object, the copy will not be modified. A deep copy can be created using serialization or by manually copying each field of an object2.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.</h3>
