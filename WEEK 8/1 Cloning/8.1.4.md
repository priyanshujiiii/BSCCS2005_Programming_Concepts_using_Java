<h3>In Java, Object.clone() method creates and returns a new object that is a copy of the original object. To use the clone() method in a class, the class must implement the Cloneable interface and override the clone() method.

In the given code, the Example class implements the Cloneable interface and overrides the clone() method to create a copy of the current object.

The line Example obj2=(Example)obj.clone(); creates a new instance of the Example class called obj2 by cloning the obj instance. The clone() method returns an Object that needs to be cast to Example to get the cloned object.

Then, the value of obj2.x is changed to 2. The output of the System.out.println() statements shows that the value of x in obj has not changed because it is a separate instance from obj2, which was created by cloning obj. Therefore, the output will be:</h3>
