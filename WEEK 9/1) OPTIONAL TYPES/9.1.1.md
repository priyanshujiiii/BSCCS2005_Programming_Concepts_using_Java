```java
public class User{
	private String name;
	private String pass;
	public void setUser(String name,String pass){
	this.name=name;
	   this.pass=pass;
	    checkUser();
       }
	private void checkUser(){
	  if(pass.equals("1234")){
	     System.out.println("Welcome, "+name.toUpperCase());
	}
	else{
	   System.out.println("Sorry, "+name.toUpperCase());
	}
    }
 }
 public class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	    User obj=new User();
	    obj.setUser("Moon","4321");
	    obj.setUser(null,"4321");
	    obj.setUser("Sun","1234");
	}
  }
```

This code is written in Java and consists of two classes, User and Test.

The User class has two private member variables name and pass, and two methods setUser() and checkUser().

The setUser() method takes two string arguments name and pass, sets the values of name and pass to the class variables, and then calls the checkUser() method.

The checkUser() method checks if the value of pass is equal to "1234". If it is, it prints a welcome message with the value of name in uppercase letters. If not, it prints a sorry message with the value of name in uppercase letters.

The Test class has a main() method which creates an object of the User class and calls the setUser() method with different arguments.

Specifically, in the main() method,

```yaml
User obj=new User(); creates an object of the User class named obj.
obj.setUser("Moon","4321"); calls the setUser() method with arguments "Moon" and "4321". The output will be "Sorry, MOON" since the password does not match.
obj.setUser(null,"4321"); calls the setUser() method with arguments null and "4321". This will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown, since name is null and cannot be used to call the toUpperCase() method.
obj.setUser("Sun","1234"); calls the setUser() method with arguments "Sun" and "1234". The output will be "Welcome, SUN" since the password matches.
```
